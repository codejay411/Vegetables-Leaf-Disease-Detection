                                    <li> Damping off of tomato occurs in two stages, i.e. the pre-emergence and the post-emergence
                                        phase.</li>

                                        The post-emergence phase is characterized by the infection of the young, juvenile tissues of

                                    <li>This is a common disease of tomato occurring on the foliage at any stage of the growth.</li>
                                <li>The fungus attacks the foliage causing characteristic leaf spots and blight. Early blight is
                                first observed on the plants as small, black lesions mostly on the older foliage.</li>
                                <li>Spots enlarge, and by the time they are one-fourth inch in diameter or larger, concentric
                                rings in a bull's eye pattern can be seen in the center of the diseased area.</li>
                                <li>Tissue surrounding the spots may turn yellow. If high temperature and humidity occur at this
                                time, much of the foliage is killed.</li>
                                <li>Lesions on the stems are similar to those on leaves, sometimes girdling the plant if they
                                occur near the soil line.</li>
                                <li>Transplants showing infection by the late blight fungus often die when set in the field. The
                                fungus also infects the fruit, generally through the calyx or stem attachment.</li>
                                <li>Lesions attain considerable size, usually involving nearly the entire fruit; concentric
                                rings are also present on the fruit.</li>

                                    <li>Primary: The fungus spends the winter in infected plant debris in or on the soil where it
                                        can survive at least one and perhaps several years. It can also be seed borne.</li>
                                        <li>Secondary: The spores are transported by water, wind, insects, other animals including man,
                                        and machinery. Once the initial infections have occurred, they become the most important
                                        source of new spore production and are responsible for rapid disease spread.</li>

                                    <li>Moist weather and splattering rains are conducive to disease development. Most outbreaks of
                                        the disease can be traced back to heavy rainstorms that occur in the area.</li>
                                        <li>Infected leaves show small, brown, water soaked, circular spots surrounded with yellowish
                                        halo.</li>
                                        <li>On older plants the leaflet infection is mostly on older leaves and may cause serious

                                        <li>The most striking symptoms are on the green fruit. Small, water-soaked spots first appear
                                        which later become raised and enlarge until they are one-eighth to one-fourth inch in

                                        <li>Centers of these lesions become irregular, light brown and slightly sunken with a rough,

                                        <li>Ripe fruits are not susceptible to the disease. Surface of the seed becomes contaminated
                                        with the bacteria, remaining on the seed surface for some time.</li>
                                        <li>The organism survives in alternate hosts, on volunteer tomato plants and on infected plant

                                Characteristic symptoms of bacterial wilt are the rapid and complete wilting of normal grown
                                up plants.
                                Lower leaves may drop before wilting. Pathogen is mostly confined to vascular region; in
                                advantage cases, it may invade the cortex and pith and cause yellow brown discolouration of
                                tissues.
                                Infected plant parts when cut and immersed in clear water, a white streak of bacterial ooze
                                are seen coming out from cut ends.

                                Leaf curl disease is characterized by severe stunting of the plants with downward rolling
                                and crinkling of the leaves. The newly emerging leaves exhibit slight yellow coloration and
                                later they also show curling symptoms.
                                Older leaves become leathery and brittle. The nodes and internodes are significantly reduced
                                in size.
                                The infected plants look pale and produce more lateral branches giving a bushy appearance.
                                The infected plants remain stunted.

                                The disease is characterized by light and dark green mottling on the leaves often
                                accompanied by wilting of young leaves in sunny days when plants first become infected.
                                The leaflets of affected leaves are usually distorted, puckered and smaller than normal.
                                Sometimes the leaflets become indented resulting in "fern leaf" symptoms.
                                The affected plant appears stunted, pale green and spindly.
    
    
                                Survival and spread
                                The virus is spread by contact with clothes, hand of working labour, touching of infected
                                plants with healthy ones, plant debris and implements.
                                Tomato spotted wilt diseaseDamage symptoms
                                Symptoms vary among hosts and in a single host species
                                Stunting is a common symptom of TSWV infection
                                Chlorotic or necrotic rings form on the leaves of many infected hosts
                                Thickening of veins and bronzing of young leaves
                                Growing tips may die-back and terminal branches may be streaked
                                Affected plants may have a one sided growth habit or may be entirely stunted and have
                                drooping leaves, suggesting a wilt
                                Pale red or yellow areas with concentric circular marking in the normal red skin of ripe
                                tomato are formed
                                Discoloration of seed.

                                Primary: Virus particles in infected plants of many hosts like Acanthospermum hispidum,
                                Aster sp., Boerhaavia diffusa, Chrysanthemum sp., Cleome gynandra, cowpea, Dahlia
                                variabilis, egg plant, French bean, Gerbera sp., groundnut, Lagasca mollis, lettuce,
                                marigold, pea, chilli, pineapple, potato, Trianthema portulacastrum, water melon and Zinnia
                                elegans
                                Secondary: Virus particles transmitted by thrips, Frankliniella schultzii, Scirtothrips
                                dorsalis.
                                Fusarium wiltDamage symptoms
                                The first symptom of the disease is clearing of the veinlets and chlorosis of the leaves.
                                The younger leaves may die in succession and the entire may wilt and die in a course of few
                                days. Soon the petiole and the leaves droop and wilt.
                                In young plants, symptom consists of clearing of veinlet and dropping of petioles. In field,
                                yellowing of the lower leaves first and affected leaflets wilt and die.
                                The symptoms continue in subsequent leaves. At later stage, browning of vascular system
                                occurs. Plants become stunted and die.
