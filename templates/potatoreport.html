                                     <ul>
                                          <li>The symptoms of bacterial wilt infection can be seen on all parts of
                                               infected
                                               plants.</li>
                                          <li>Infected plant begins to wilt, starting from the tips of the leaves or where
                                               the
                                               stems branch out, and then spreading to all parts of the plant.</li>
                                          <li>Leaves become yellow at their bases, then the whole plant wilts and dies.
                                               When
                                               stems are cut a brown colored ring will be visible.</li>
                                          <li>When a tuber is cut in half, black or brown rings will, however, be visible.
                                               If
                                               left for a while or squeezed, these rings will exude a thick white fluid.
                                          </li>
  
                                          <li>A further symptom is fluid coming out of tuber eyes. This can be signified
                                               by
                                               soil sticking to tuber eyes when crops are harvested. Serious infection
                                               causes
                                               tubers to rot.</li>
  
                                     </ul>

                                     <h4>Disease symptoms:</h4>
                                     <ul>
                                          <li>This disease damages leaves, stems and tubers. Affected leaves appear blistered
                                               as if scalded by hot water and eventually rot and dry out.</li>
                                          <li>When drying out, leaves turn brown or black in color. When infections are still
                                               active, spots appear on the underside of leaves blanketed in what looks like
                                               flour.</li>
                                          <li>Affected stems begin to blacken from their tips, and eventually dry out.
                                               </li>
                                          <li>Severe infections cause all foliage to rot, dry out and fall to the ground,
                                               stems to dry out and plants to die.</li>
                                          <li>Affected tubers display dry brown-colored spots on their skins and flesh. This
                                               disease acts very quickly. If it is not controlled, infected plants will die
                                               within two or three days.</li>
                                          
                                          
                                     </ul>
                                     <h4>Favourable condition:</h4>
                                     <ul>
                                          <li>High humidity
                                               
                                               </li>
                                          <li>Low temperature and leaf wetness</li>

                                     <h2 class="text-warning">Early blight</h2>
                                     <h4>Disease symptoms:</h4>
                                     <ul>
                                          <li>This is a common disease of potato occurring on the foliage at any stage of the growth and causes characteristic leaf spots and blight.</li>
                                               <li>Normally the disease symptoms become apparent during tuber bulking stage and develop leading to the harvest.</li>
                                               <li>The early blight is first observed on the plants as small, black lesions mostly on the older foliage.</li>
                                               <li>Spots enlarge, and by the time they are one-fourth inch in diameter or larger, concentric rings in a bull's eye pattern can be seen in the center of the diseased area.</li>
                                               <li>Tissue surrounding the spots may turn yellow. If high temperature and humidity occur at this time, much of the foliage is killed.</li>
                                               <li>Lesions on the stems are similar to those on leaves, sometimes girdling the plant if they occur near the soil line.</li>
                                               
                                               
                                          
                                          
                                     </ul>
                                     <h4>Favourable condition:</h4>
                                     <ul>
                                          <li>Warm, rainy and wet weather
                                               </li>
