# About vegetables disease detection project

Farmers who grow potatoes are facing lot of economic losses every year because of
various disease that can happen to a potato plant. There are two common types of disease
known as early blight and late blight. Early blight caused by fungus and late blight caused by
specific microorganism.
If farmers are able to detect there disease early and apply appropriate treatment then it
can save lot of waste and prevent the economic loss. The treatment for early blight and late
blight are little different. So, its important that farmers accurately identified what kind of
disease is there in that potato plant. So, here we are developed an application for farmers to
detect what type of disease are in potato plant.
We use village vegetables from Kaggle and do data cleaning and pre-processing of data
after that we go for model building by CNN (Convolutional Neural network).
Now we only work for potato plant and later on we are going to implement at least 3-4
vegetables so that farmers use this application od multiple vegetables.
Planning: -
1. Data Collection
2. Model Building (TensorFlow, CNN)
3. Backend work
4. Deployment
